## Introduction
Nodaji is an e-commerce platform that provides an intuitive and easy way to buy/sell clothing.

E-commerce platforms for new/used clothing in Korea are mostly embedded in traditional internet cafe platforms such as Naver Cafe. While they have quite a large user base, traditional platforms such as Naver Cafe lack the features to provide an optimal platform for buying/selling clothing such as messaging, secure payment, etc. Additionally, the lack of a unified platform is a discomfort for users as they must go through multiple routes to complete a transaction. Therefore, we have researched, analyzed, and developed a e-commerce platform targeting such users.


### What is Nodaji?
As a BUYER, I would like to easily search for, find, and buy an item without having to go through multiple platforms. Additionally, I would like to communicate with the buyer within such platform to negotiate item prices. Lastly, I would like to be able to purchase a product without the fear of being scammed.

As a SELLER, I would like to easily list my item for sale and find buyers without having to go through multiple platforms. Additionally, I would like to be able to communicate with multiple buyers on one platform in order to find the most optimal price for such product.

Nodaji is a platform that satisfies the above user requirements. Mainly our platform provides the following features:
  1. Buy/sell clothing
  2. Communicate within Nodaji app to buyer/seller through instant messaging
  3. Leave reviews/ratings

## Scope
